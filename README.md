> `txts` for use with Botnik

Repo to store some `txt` file for using with [Botnik Predictive Writer app](http://botnik.org/apps/writer/). I will probably use this for lyric writing inspiration.

In addition to simple storing `txt` files to use with Botnik Predictive Writer, I intend to write some (probably [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)...) simple application to concatenate/combine multiple `txt` files into a single file for use together.

After that I may look at writing some (probably [React](https://reactjs.org/)...) frontend application to create/manage `txt` files in this repository and to decide which files to combine together into a single file for use with Botnik Predictive Writer.
