The pessimistic you, the merciless you
The self loving, what are you looking at there?

Amidst the comparison and proportions
You're screaming yourself mad.
This is what you wanted, right?
You must be a romanticist

All of a sudden I thought back, there's no love here.
Run through again and again, I'm goign to break somewhere.

Love me please. my blood, the meaning behind it
Love me please, give this value to this day.

Gasp for breath
That's right, ask that pig with meat
That you lose your heart because you spend money to fulfill
That girl laughs at your sorry face
That's right, the love underneath the suit
That's right, the politeness underneath the suit

Even if you don't know the answer to the simple question of C
The eyes to see the reality is far more important
I laugh at the sorry sky
That's right, the love underneath the sunny day
That's right, underneath the sunny day . . .

All you people looking at me, you just say what you want
You never some and reach your hand out to me
You buy love for me on my birthday
Today it's cloudy and partly rain

Actuality, I want to love the world before me
Actuality, I do, but

dead freedom
If you've forgotten how to scream then scream right here and live right here
I will scream as much as I want and if my voice dies, then let my voice die
If you've forgotten how to scream then scream right here and live right here
I will scream no matter how many times I die My voice will die
But I will scream here my heart
We can dive
Where's the fortunate future?
Where does our fortunate future come?

dick men
fuck offÂ fuck off
and wipe
(Get back my merrily memory)

under the sun
To be revealed as if you were to be ridiculed, the disclosure of the flow of the red river

You walk the mountain road made of corpses smiling
Again you reach out and ants gather around the lily
under the sun
People that can't redeem have ash, tears, and taciturnity in both their hands . . .
What's Cruel is that the Sun and the Moon comes together
Even tomorrow looks away
On the Red Day you question taciturnity and . . .
I have lived in restrict   I want to disappear more than to forget
I laugh back at people like you, who act like you understand

You people just live on laughing, saying something good will happen tomorrow
There was always something different about you and me and
the way you talk from the beginning

It's not unusual anymore to get hurt by you
So again when you hurt me, I just laugh back at you

Just wishing it wasn't real is my only negative way to escape . . .

ash to ash
I am just garbage with an umbrella So give me my dream
I am used to hiding underneath the umbrella So I want you for me
Can you hear me?
The dance holds together this little girl As she waits for the morning
The best friend   She has no one to wave to anymore

The good old days are so dear
The ashes are like flower petals that rise up to the sky

Say good bye as we torch the fire to the victims stacked up
The ashes are like flower petals that rise up to the sky

Let's put on a dress and dance
I gave her my endless love   But she cries aloud . . . So I
Now take off the dress and go to sleep
The endless love The little girl with happiness on her sleeping face is gone

The decomposed dress and the leg of the little girl
I carry
I will communicate with love
I will kill with emotion
From that very day I was able to laugh freely . . .
Do you think that was a long time ago? I thought

The threatening world pressuring in?
Meaning that world would be outside of the cage?
Eventually I will get used to it, but when will this scar disappear?

Let's go out into the city with a bat
Come and play with me more

Do it now. God bless me! Bless you!
I cry from pain
ominous communication

You must be happy with logics and contradictions

When unhappiness creeps in
The meaning of that doesn't change
Am I laughing well in your world?

Who is more tragic?
You are probably more serious

I'll probably be able to laugh more when I am torn and hurt

False accusations kill me

Cries of grief will lead you to Jesus

Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
Let's meet up in a sigh

Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
Bound together firmly
Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
With no way out it is shaved off
Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
As dark as dark sky and earth, dizzily mad
As sore as sore the back of the gullet, dizziness

You can't catch me,   can't catch me
Can blind birds fly? They can't

I go up   the blind stairs intently

Ladies and gentlemen, time is over
Ladies and gentlemen, please die

My child flowing down the sewer is a piece of incompetence
Can't grasp anything with my hands

Like a garbage I go back to doing

Whatever I wish, it's weed life

Night and day at the end of the day, all day and so every day
I scream even in my dreams I want to become happy

Rosy lipstick My child laughing is a sign of incompetence
Self torture . . . abuse . . . die . . . wanna forget . . . I hate
The song game of counting petals
MY COMEUPPANCE AND YOUR IGNORANCE

LYRICAL SHOW TIME
Full of ABILITY It's the Blood Red SHOW TIME  SHOW TIME
COMICAL SHOW TIME
Inflammation of VITALITY It's the Blood Red SHOW TIME
CYNICAL SHOW TIME
REALITY Comes to life It's the Blood Red SHOW TIME
SHOW TIME
RADICAL SHOW TIME
ETERNITY breaks It's the Blood Red SHOW TIME

That's right, I still can't find the meaning of my existence
That's why I slice the meaning on my body more and more and more and more
-Go ahead and laugh, and just walk away-

The voices of backstabbers still stick to me
Someday maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe the voice will be heard straight to my heart
-Go ahead and just laugh, and break away-

HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
NO THANK YOU! NO THANK YOU! . . . GOOD BYE!
HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
It's better then to not even notice

MY COMEUPPANCE AND YOUR IGNORANCE
THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT (GO AHEAD!)

HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
NO THANK YOU! NO THANK YOU! . . . GOOD BYE!
HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
HURRY UP! HURRY UP! WRIST-CUT SHOW!
SHOW TIME It's none of my business . . . hehehe

THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT (GO AHEAD!)
PLEASE COME TO THE LAST GASP WITH ME (MY PLEASURE)
Here is some water for the dead tree... I see your reflection in the dirty water...
Dreams and aspirations Your ideals in the big sky
Passionate Red
The one I loved so much...
Ideals being sweeter then candy are just ideals

No-one wants the present

Point your finger Goodbye
I feel love on my forehead at gun point
Even the child with the red coat swallows her tears as she faces reality

Why? Why? Over and Over
It will never heal
Why? Why? Over and Over
My dead heart...

Love, tenderness, freedom and peace
The intention is clear, I stare . . . with this left hand, unable to be worded
Every time I bleed, there lies the reason to live . . . And I discover words being so vivid and bright

Even loved ones scatter like petals from flowers in my hand
So even if I engraved the meaning that I lived in my hand, it will only be known as flowers of vanity

the final

One by one it multiplies . . . why be a sad bait?

Deep within the hell of my heart . . . I can't go back
A self-torture loser, not being able to see tomorrow
Suicide is the proof of life

Even loved ones scatter like petals from flowers in my hand
So even if I engraved the meaning that I lived in my hand, the petals will just scatter as flowers of vanity

So I can't live
What's lost can't be born again

A song that's not even seeking the proof of living
Let's put an end . . . the final

Let's bloom flowers of attempted suicide . . .
He looks down on me
So, I will love him until I die
His face is his number one pride
Stupid motherfucker
Die

He deceives me
No, actually he's being deceived by me
Go to hell and get the fuck out of my way
You baby boy

He respects me
But he doesn't want to admit it
Don't be spellbound by your weakness
Why don't you just go and kiss up to that ho

I'm gonna hit you up with this here fresh
I'm gonna hit you up with that there fresh

Here is the very best ballad for you
You drown in hypocritical sin
The very best ballad for you
The one I love and adore number - 4


I'm gonna hit you up with this here tower
I'm gonna hit you up with that there tower

blow

You, just living is a pollution
You, just living is a sin
You are living. So please die
You know me, I just shut my eyes to my own shortcoming . . . hehe
So I want you for me to die

Hide your bloodshot eyes   Swallow your loneliness   The voices pressures to
Your words that ask for me   The joy of being needed
I bite my nails just a little

Hide your crying wrists   The spilling milk   The persistent cat becomes silent
You don't want it but can't take your eyes off of the spilled milk
Is that love? Mistake?
I look at you just a little

I picture the swaying vision   Of the reality being real   You test me persistently
You get angry when I don't agree   You lose yourself
And I fall in love with you once again

Can't be touched   Won't be touched

blind sorrow

I know it's hard for you to wait for me, so don't cry, go ahead and sleep
What do you want from me? If I say to you that you look beautiful, will you be able to sleep?

You stare at the flower by the window, without even blinking
You want what you can't have, You wish to be pregnant But the only thing you can't bear is this child's . . .
It's so dark and dark and dreadful Let's calm down with an old tale
I am good at pretending to cry So I spill the milk and I yell her the truth about not being pregnant

Don't do an excessive thing
The sadness on the face will probably be gone tomorrow
When did my eyes become dead?

What is waiting for me tomorrow as I sing and live without meaning?
Alone in my room as my heartbeat screams
Don't kid yourself and don't fool yourself

I am addicted to the perceived fate
I am alone I linger on to this fate
Don't kid yourself and don't wound yourself

The unstoppable rain   The unstoppable sound   The unstoppable rain
The unstoppable love   The unstoppable song . . .
I can't stop it anymore
I can't handle it anymore

Kill the voice  Close your eyes   Drown in the darkness Roam around
I won't depend on anyone anymore
Kill the voice   Close your eyes   Drown in the darkness Roam around
I keep inside me your keen voice . . .
All in darkness

It's such an irony this sunny bright weather
-Good Morning-
