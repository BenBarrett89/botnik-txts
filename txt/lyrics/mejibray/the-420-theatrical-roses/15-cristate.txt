If you don't know how to kill, then think about ways to hide

As long as I'm alive inside you, the music will continue to play every day
The sound might not be the same but making it your world and voicing it should be your reason to live

It's okay to live in there
It's okay to just pretend on the outside
I'll do your part too

I hope I can stay here and make you my reason to live every day
Imagining your world is fun and I hope I can start feeling like I want to stay here a bit longer
I'm not forcing you to live every day
But why are you over there?

I think I understand, actually
It's because you won't stop singing there

You had told me
That,
"I'm here because you're alive"

so close... yet so far
Even with the red shoes
Crying, trembling, I am turning cristate
Since this is the world we choose to live in,
"We'll make it so that I am you, and you are me"
