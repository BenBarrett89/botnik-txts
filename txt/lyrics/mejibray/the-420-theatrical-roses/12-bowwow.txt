Have you not noticed
what I always do?
BITE & LICK
BITE & LICK
When I bite I won't let go

Touched by pain,
I smile with a tear-stained face
BITE & LICK
BITE & LICK
When I bite I won't let go

At least the lyricism of the present moment, flaunted as freedom,
should be incomprehensible to lacking minds

The late-night show is loud until the very end
You draw close to stroke my head
Limits reached, an applause of hearts gushes forth
This useless dog with bad memory is enough for you

"Hey, d'you know? That food tastes bad"
"Hey, are you listening? Pet me"
