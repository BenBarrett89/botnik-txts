RED draws so very near
Let's go look for flowers
Let's go, shutting out even that place where we were suspended in chains

You end up disappearing
This world is so vast
Where is the fiction that makes us forget even the hurtful things?

Children dressed as the devil
Are soldiers guarding that place
Let's acquire the art of cunning in exchange for common knowledge

hatred x tangle red x WORLD
=hatred x hunger red
Just about everyone forces someone to step back so they can thrive
hatred x tangle red x WORLD
Ôºùhatred x hunger red
This time when I've stopped saying "I'm just alive" could last forever too

From the hidden cracks
The corpse of a kitten is laughing,
Telling me to choose eternal sleep if my future will be spent abandoned

I am a slave, a slave that's been forced into something in this world
Will the answer I've been waiting so much for come? If needed, I'm monochrome
