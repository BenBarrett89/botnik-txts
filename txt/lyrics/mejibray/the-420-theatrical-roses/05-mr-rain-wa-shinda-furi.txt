Mr. Rain woke up
Up until yesterday, which was solidified and dry...
Though his eyes were closed,
Though he conversed,
It's coming in
It won't disappear

OD... Mr. Rain
Has gotten tired... of thinking
Though he opens the door,
Though he keeps walking,
It's coming in
It won't disappear

Time does not stop even though I act like I'm dead
The attacking arrows are like centipedes frightening me
It's okay
I'm crying
If there's such a "thing" as living,
I'll let you know,
Of the view beyond

Mr. Rain screams alone
I decide that there is no death for gods
If I can make it so that I am the god for those who are looking for light

Time does not stop even though I act like I'm dead
The attacking arrows are like centipedes frightening me
It's okay
I'm crying
I guess there is such a "thing" as living?
I'll let you hear,
The painful view
