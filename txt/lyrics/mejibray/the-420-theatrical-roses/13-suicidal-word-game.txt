I chew to bits many a pill
And keep crying, failing to fall asleep
This dulling is to hide the past
But without me noticing, the hurt just increases

I gulp down Platinum to the last drop
Out comes the smoke of sadness
Words get pounded down quickly
"For how long should I smile?"
I'm told delusions are free of charge
â€˜Adorning body in love'
I pledge, "I'll smile! From now on"
Please stop!
"What do you know?"

Ah... my unappreciated song
Ah... honest leader, ask

I want to destroy, I want to destroy
I take love in my hands
And I myself can't respond,
But I close my eyes and try to smile
We'll continue living,
Through these ugly suicide attempts
