Why are you,
Why are you,
Slitting your wrists thinking you want to die?
It'll leave scars
And if tomorrow does come tears will come too...

Why am I,
Why am I,
Thinking about living?
Let's join hands and dive,
Into countless vortices

A spoonful of happiness...
Just like a drug, turns even dying into a regrettable thing

A dying man needs to die.
"Are you not alive because you're desperate to find 'THAT' which seems to be bursting apart?"

Why are you,
Why are you,
Diving in alone,
Thinking your existence is a nuisance,
And that you're loved by no one

Why am I,
Why am I,
Taken prisoner by living?
Inside countless vortices,
I sing to countless scars

It must be difficult for you to fly with just one wing, so I'll give you a push...

We take knives into our right hands, thinking it strange
That there are people alive all over the world

A dying man needs to die.
I am your missing wing
Are you not alive so you can someday find "something"?
