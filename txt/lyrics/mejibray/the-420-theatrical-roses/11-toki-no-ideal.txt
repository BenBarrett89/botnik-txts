Light,
Hide the truth now
I beg of you
For a momentary Ideal

Ah... I kick away the countless glass beads that have scattered about
I shake with this pain that's piercing through my body again
Ah... I don't even want to take in that sight, the treachery and the sheep's eyes
I'm deluding myself again, saying things like "is this fate"

pray... This world is forever the same
ray... I don't even want to save it

Light,
Encircle the pain now,
So as to accept the hidden wounds
Light,
Hide the truth now,
I beg of you
For a momentary Ideal

Ah... A jet-black bell tolls, my fingertips are cut off
Again my freedom is taken, and swarming eyes are laughing
Ah... "Shall we destroy together?" Waiting anxiously for those words,
Again I'm attacked by the passage of time and I start running away

pray... This world is forever the same
ray... I want for you to start saving it

Light,
Shine on the pain now,
So as to outline the hidden wounds
Light,
Show me the truth now,
And draw me
A momentary Ideal
