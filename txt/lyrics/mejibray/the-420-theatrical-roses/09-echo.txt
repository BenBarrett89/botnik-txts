Once I had turned away, in those clear days
Came beckoning a thread of innocence
Was that the "tragedy" slipping through the cracks I had closed off?

If I put it into words, I can only send a bitter gift of farewell to the past...
And the memories of it will still pierce through my skin, like glass

If you want, I will become whatever you wish me to be
The past I'd turned away from was shaken by that sound
Unable to even make eye contact, I stopped listening to the silence
Because I know your pain too

If I pretend to smile when once again I begin to shut everything out,
Will you cry? Or will you smile at me?

Our fingers searched for each other as if we were about to fall
You'd cried like a child, and I didn't want to spoil that image,
So I closed my eyes

If you want, I will become whatever you wish me to be
Taken by surprise, I cried... there is rain outside
"If you are not here with me, I'll disappear"
An echo of codependency

If suddenly you were to die,
I'd surely feel relieved
I'd have no reason to cry,
Or to be in pain,
Or to love...

[ "I like you,"
A moment condensed into words
The past I'd turned away from was shaken by that sound ]

[ "Because I love you," I held you as you were falling apart
Taken by surprise, I cried... there is rain outside ]

If "you" want, I will become whatever you wish me to be
I can count the free spaces on my fingers...
Even if a deep darkness awaits in the future I can't yet see,
The past has now bloomed,
And is falling into an endless abyss...

I calmly gathered the vestiges of dried rain,
Along with eternity
