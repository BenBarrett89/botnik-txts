I surrender myself to the shapeless melody
Gloom... and strangely shining transience

Again I take them into my hand and draw, a simple sundown
With a spoon, I mix into it, a prayer

Hey, you can hear it
The shadow turning lighter,
The arpeggio inside threatening sheets opening up

I wonder if you'll secretly cry and what you'll draw
inside this shadow that is carrying my song again
It'll get painful for me and I'll scream
inside your shadow that is carrying over my song again

"It seems the separate volumes have become one volume"
You're already like me, you who blurted that out

You cried at the concealing walls like a child,
as you fell asleep seeped in my voice
I hate the times when I can't see a thing
in the shadow of the present that is carrying another future
I wonder if you'll secretly cry and what you'll draw
inside this shadow that is carrying my song again
It'll get painful for me and I'll scream
inside your shadow that is carrying over my song again
