When I escape because it's painful, the angel of emotion makes it rain.
The potency of senses...

I don't care for "tear-jerkers" just like I don't care for the final passages in cliche novels

Hungry Psychopath
I'm breaking again
I'm drowning again
Magical words are unclear
I'm hungry 1
Hungry Psychopath
I'm destroying again
We're drowning together
The words when we met...
You got hungry again, didn't you?

There must have arisen some worldwide discrepancies between the ideal and the reality.
The hue of melancholy...

I'll go pick you
The sky is blue
so I can increase myself

Hungry Psychopath
I'm breaking again
I'm drowning again
Magical words are unclear
I'm hungry
Hungry Psychopath
I'm destroying again
We're drowning together
The words when we met...
You got hungry again, didn't you?

Somewhere behind your ears
There might be another you

Hungry Psychopath
I'm breaking again
I'm drowning again
Magical words are unclear
I'm hungry
Hungry Psychopath
"Stealing my heart... what do you mean?"
「Just making your stomach hurt out of nowhere... something like that.」
Lyrical with you
