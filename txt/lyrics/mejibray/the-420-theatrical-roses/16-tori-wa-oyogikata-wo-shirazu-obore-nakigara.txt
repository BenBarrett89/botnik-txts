Shadow dances aflicker,
Falling as if directed to
A burning, sweet dream

They get washed away slowly
Black hair, the marionette
No bare body to be seen

The wings are now broken,
Ah, ah…
By the colour of sins hidden away
And I can forget,
Ah, ah…
After the scent is buried away

Light dances down from the sky,
Strikes through my heart
And bright red rain starts to fall
It's ending… Isn't it lovely?
Light dances down from the sky,
Tears out my outstretched arm,
And I die, drowned in the past
Streaming down my face

I buckle, wanting to be loved
I splashed on Egoiste
Shall we…dance like this?

As if covering my mouth,
My hair that's grown longer
Rejects the songs of despair

Dramatic words will again
Make this room lonesome
Broken sounds will visit my ears

You dance down from the sky
Full of dreams,
Your shining irises are quite radiant
I dance down from the sky
Obscuring meanings,
I had been blooming
In time, I'll die by drowning
