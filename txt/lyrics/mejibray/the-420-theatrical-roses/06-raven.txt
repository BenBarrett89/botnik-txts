The flightless RAVEN

Echoing, voices that raised the flag
are slowly disappearing

Vicious executioners
Set fire to the minority
"Don't worry, you won't die"
It's all full of negligence and looking the other way
The big-shots say, "Focus on the future in front of you!"
People are worried
But instead of that, we are questioning the days that we live in now

When we speak up, we're shot down
Adults say silent disapprovals with their eyes
Keyboards that remove sound's colour are scrapped, done away with, and we lose sight of the future
Costumes that signed the contract
Get washed over by the waves of this situation,
And as just one tiny thread snaps, we are abandoned into the darkness of isolation

On mornings when we wish for death, nothing but hope starts to melt from our mouths
People around don't notice those who are crying
Wings clouded with black won't help us see the future
On nights when we wish to disappear there isn't a single place we can hide into
We were supposed to stay together yet still lose each other along the way
And whether someday we'll see light after taking the jump...

There is no light

Hello, flightless Birthday!!

We don't know where to turn
We don't know ourselves
Saying a thing like â€˜I want to die' makes this world a worse place
This is a world where information is thrown around carelessly
Our wounds are forsaken,
And as we block out the words that come welling up, they turn into loneliness full of tears

Will our voices also be heard, so that morning can come again?
In the days that ought to come someday,
We will be the wandering ravens
We don't mind even if we get wounds we cannot speak of
We are alive so we will shout now

Though we're alive, someday we'll die
If we keep living, someday we'll still die
So shouldn't we be able to feel happiness
For a single moment of our time in this life?
