Dazzling evil disturbs those who have fallen into hellfire
The devil with no wings gives himself over to me
He bows his head down and wanders, thirsting for new blood
Now stuck in the same cycle of life, he cuts out pentagrams

Nauseated, I'm puzzled by the shiny blue gems I devour
I had put too much trust in my own strength, and now wail with pain
I will stroke your head, and only today give you candy
That shaking body adorned with piercings that was given to meâ€“I will force it to transform itself

Pledge your loyalty,
I grin
We'll exchange cups
Offer up prayers to me until your life ends
I'll put rewards in my songs...
Pledge your loyalty,
I grin
I'll hold you close
Should your life end I'll shed tears for you
I'll put rewards in my voice...
