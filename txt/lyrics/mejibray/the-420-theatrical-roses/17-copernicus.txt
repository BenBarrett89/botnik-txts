"Yes, we must make a choice. For the future."

A NEW
START
FOR OUR FUTURE
FOR OUR TOMORROW

"WE'LL START TO MOVE"

Did you know?
That there are different sides
to this world we are seeing.

"The rain won't last forever"
is something I've sung somewhere, however

I
want to continue sending
"that endless rain"
even if its form isn't that of droplets fallen from the sky.

-Fin... ?-
