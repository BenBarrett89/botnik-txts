"Theatrical blue-black"
The time is up... for the two-sided identity

Sometimes, spoiling your insides by eating stale stories can be a kind of pleasure too?
Somebody had said, "Isn't dying a great luxury?"
So by "I want to die" I mean I'll try to live

If we take that a brilliant reputation is like crayons in 24 colours,
I am then nothing but extremely ordinary pens in 3 colours

The birdcage on my surface starts to ache
The blue-black, invisible curtain
rises up after the show's end and, I, paint the sky

"Theatrical blue-black"
I'll implant in you a deadly medicine,
"Theatrical blue-black"
A certain splendid way you can fly too
And as our artistic intents join together, our hearts will be more for it

Severed, the sky won't recover

If you dream of tomorrow, it means you're aware of yesterday's pain
So we should only think about walking through the present
The curtain rises up after the show's end and, I, paint the sky

"Theatrical blue-black"
Won't you make "us" the air "you" breathe?
"Theatrical blue-black"
I will repaint it for you,
This green scenery

People keep going through life in pain

"Theatrical black shine"
I will repaint it together with you,
Using our invisible wings
