Nameless
We continue to have thoughts
Nameless
And feel pain
Nameless
We’ve been put through trials
From that day forward,
We have been killed,
And forced to fight...

"I wonder what is it that we can do?"
Suddenly I notice we are now alive in this world
In this world that took a mere seven days to create
Seven days ago we were just wandering aimlessly

We see this earth armed with well-worn concrete
And this sky that keeps on changing
That is our reality and we won’t stop believing that we’re alive
"Maybe it’s a dream"
But who decides that something is a dream?

Flowers have blossomed and come to bear seeds
The words we need to live once again start to go against us
Inside that blue ring hellfire burns
Killing each other our hearts have sunk
Unable to smile…and alone

"Say you decided to get rid of your current self..."
‘I would want to become one with you and destroy it all’

Whether it’s the water I need to be saved, or the insects that are here to destroy
People will believe nothing but things they have seen with their "own eyes"

Nameless
We who have begun to raise our voices
And the one who has vanished due to those voices
And lost their name
Belong to the future I’ve said a tearful goodbye to that day
Belong to the past full of pain that I’ve destroyed

I want to keep on living
Without having to fight
If only a pain"less" day would come...
