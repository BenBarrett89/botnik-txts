Where's the fortunate future?
Where does our fortunate future come?

dick men
fuck offÂ fuck off
and wipe
(Get back my merrily memory)

under the sun
To be revealed as if you were to be ridiculed, the disclosure of the flow of the red river

You walk the mountain road made of corpses smiling
Again you reach out and ants gather around the lily
under the sun
People that can't redeem have ash, tears, and taciturnity in both their hands . . .
What's Cruel is that the Sun and the Moon comes together
Even tomorrow looks away
On the Red Day you question taciturnity and . . .
