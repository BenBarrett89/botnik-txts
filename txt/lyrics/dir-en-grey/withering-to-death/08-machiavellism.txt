That's right, I still can't find the meaning of my existence
That's why I slice the meaning on my body more and more and more and more
-Go ahead and laugh, and just walk away-

The voices of backstabbers still stick to me
Someday maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe the voice will be heard straight to my heart
-Go ahead and just laugh, and break away-
