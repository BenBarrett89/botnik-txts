The dance holds together this little girl As she waits for the morning
The best friend   She has no one to wave to anymore

The good old days are so dear
The ashes are like flower petals that rise up to the sky

Say good bye as we torch the fire to the victims stacked up
The ashes are like flower petals that rise up to the sky

Let's put on a dress and dance
I gave her my endless love   But she cries aloud . . . So I
Now take off the dress and go to sleep
The endless love The little girl with happiness on her sleeping face is gone

The decomposed dress and the leg of the little girl
I carry
