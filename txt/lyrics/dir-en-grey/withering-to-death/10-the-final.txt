The intention is clear, I stare . . . with this left hand, unable to be worded
Every time I bleed, there lies the reason to live . . . And I discover words being so vivid and bright

Even loved ones scatter like petals from flowers in my hand
So even if I engraved the meaning that I lived in my hand, it will only be known as flowers of vanity

the final

One by one it multiplies . . . why be a sad bait?

Deep within the hell of my heart . . . I can't go back
A self-torture loser, not being able to see tomorrow
Suicide is the proof of life

Even loved ones scatter like petals from flowers in my hand
So even if I engraved the meaning that I lived in my hand, the petals will just scatter as flowers of vanity

So I can't live
What's lost can't be born again

A song that's not even seeking the proof of living
Let's put an end . . . the final

Let's bloom flowers of attempted suicide . . .
