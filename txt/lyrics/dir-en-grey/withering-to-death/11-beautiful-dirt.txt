He looks down on me
So, I will love him until I die
His face is his number one pride
Stupid motherfucker
Die

He deceives me
No, actually he's being deceived by me
Go to hell and get the fuck out of my way
You baby boy

He respects me
But he doesn't want to admit it
Don't be spellbound by your weakness
Why don't you just go and kiss up to that ho

I'm gonna hit you up with this here fresh
I'm gonna hit you up with that there fresh

Here is the very best ballad for you
You drown in hypocritical sin
The very best ballad for you
The one I love and adore number - 4


I'm gonna hit you up with this here tower
I'm gonna hit you up with that there tower

blow

You, just living is a pollution
You, just living is a sin
You are living. So please die
You know me, I just shut my eyes to my own shortcoming . . . hehe
