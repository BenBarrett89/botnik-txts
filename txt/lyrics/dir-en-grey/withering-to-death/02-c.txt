That's right, ask that pig with meat
That you lose your heart because you spend money to fulfil
That girl laughs at your sorry face
That's right, the love underneath the suit
That's right, the politeness underneath the suit

Even if you don't know the answer to the simple question of C
The eyes to see the reality is far more important
I laugh at the sorry sky
That's right, the love underneath the sunny day
That's right, underneath the sunny day . . .

All you people looking at me, you just say what you want
You never some and reach your hand out to me
You buy love for me on my birthday
Today it's cloudy and partly rain

Actuality, I want to love the world before me
Actuality, I do, but

dead freedom
If you've forgotten how to scream then scream right here and live right here
I will scream as much as I want and if my voice dies, then let my voice die
If you've forgotten how to scream then scream right here and live right here
I will scream no matter how many times I die My voice will die
But I will scream here my heart
We can dive
