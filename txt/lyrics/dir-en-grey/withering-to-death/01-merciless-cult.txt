The pessimistic you, the merciless you
The self loving, what are you looking at there?

Amidst the comparison and proportions
You're screaming yourself mad.
This is what you wanted, right?
You must be a romanticist

All of a sudden I thought back, there's no love here.
Run through again and again, I'm going to break somewhere.

Love me please. my blood, the meaning behind it
Love me please, give this value to this day.

Gasp for breath
