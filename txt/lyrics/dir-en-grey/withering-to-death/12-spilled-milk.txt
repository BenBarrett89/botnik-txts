So I want you for me to die

Hide your bloodshot eyes   Swallow your loneliness   The voices pressures to
Your words that ask for me   The joy of being needed
I bite my nails just a little

Hide your crying wrists   The spilling milk   The persistent cat becomes silent
You don't want it but can't take your eyes off of the spilled milk
Is that love? Mistake?
I look at you just a little

I picture the swaying vision   Of the reality being real   You test me persistently
You get angry when I don't agree   You lose yourself
And I fall in love with you once again

Can't be touched   Won't be touched

blind sorrow

I know it's hard for you to wait for me, so don't cry, go ahead and sleep
What do you want from me? If I say to you that you look beautiful, will you be able to sleep?

You stare at the flower by the window, without even blinking
You want what you can't have, You wish to be pregnant But the only thing you can't bear is this child's . . .
It's so dark and dark and dreadful Let's calm down with an old tale
I am good at pretending to cry So I spill the milk and I yell her the truth about not being pregnant

Don't do an excessive thing
