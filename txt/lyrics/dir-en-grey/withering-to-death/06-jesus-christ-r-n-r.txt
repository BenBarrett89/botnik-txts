I will communicate with love
I will kill with emotion
From that very day I was able to laugh freely . . .
Do you think that was a long time ago? I thought

The threatening world pressuring in?
Meaning that world would be outside of the cage?
Eventually I will get used to it, but when will this scar disappear?

Let's go out into the city with a bat
Come and play with me more

Do it now. God bless me! Bless you!
I cry from pain
ominous communication

You must be happy with logics and contradictions

When unhappiness creeps in
The meaning of that doesn't change
Am I laughing well in your world?

Who is more tragic?
You are probably more serious

I'll probably be able to laugh more when I am torn and hurt

False accusations kill me

Cries of grief will lead you to Jesus

Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
Let's meet up in a sigh

Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
Bound together firmly
Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
With no way out it is shaved off
Jesus Christ Rock'n Roll
